#What I would improve
I feel that more functionality could be added. This was a capstone project for my graduation, while I received a great grade - I always think things could be imporved.
This project had plenty of scope creep and we only had about a month or so to complete the project, start to finish. I had to battle with nice-to-have's and need-to-have's.
